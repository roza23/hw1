I think failed big-time with this homework assignment. 
I realize I definitely do not know yet how to apply the things I learned in class. However I do feel confident that I can make some small peaces of code work on my own. 

I started reading the instructions in the index.htlm very carefully.
Then started to type some javaScript on my own with making the object in the beginning and creating some functions. 
Until a point early in the afternoon that I made more passes(11) than failures(7).

But then I got stuck and read the game_logic.test.js very carefully. With that in mind I attempted to make a good code construction. But then more and more errors showed up.
I also had a feeling that I could work with the DOM but I guess I was wrong. 

I did search for some help on the internet(stack overflow , MDN etc.) up but the problem is that I realized I do not know how to google the right combination of terms. 
Also I think that a big problem is that I didn't ask enough in class. 
And that I didn't do enough parsing on the code I made from de DYI's in the reader. (I talked about it with Mimi Yesterday)

Anyway I gave it my best and tried to make a good javaScript construction. That's all I could do in the end. 
I hope there is some time to talk about this on monday then maybe I can explain more about all of this.
