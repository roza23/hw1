I think failed bigtime with this homework assingment. 
I realize I defenetly do not know yet how to applay the things I learned in class. However I do feel confident that I can make some peaces of code work on my own. 


I started reading the instructions in the htlm file very carefully.
Then started to type some javaScript on my own with making the object in the beginning and creating some functions. 



I did look stuff up but the problem is that I realized I do not know how to google the right combination of terms.
